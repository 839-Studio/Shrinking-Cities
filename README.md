# Shrinking Cities
### Data behind Sixth Tone's multimedia project, "Shrinking Cities". http://interaction.sixthtone.com/feature/2018/shrinking-cities/#jtss-fb

The "Data" folder contains 2005 and 2015 populations of each municipalities in China. (In the case of Beijing, Tianjin, Chongqing, and Shanghai, which are municipalities of provincial level, it contains district-level populations.)

The tricky thing here is that not all provincial yearbooks contain the numbers of residents (常住人口数), so when this option is available for both years, we use these numbers; but when it is not available for either year, we use the numbers of people registered in certain municipalities/districts (户口人数). (The choice can be found in every file's "source" part.)
